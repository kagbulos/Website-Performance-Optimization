Description
-----------
The goal of this project was to optimize an online portoflio provided by Udacity. In order to achieve this, I had to optimize the critical rendering path and make the two web pages render as fast as possible. To optimize views/pizza.html, views/js/main.js was modified to the point where pizza.html achieved a frame rate of 60 fps. Additionally, index.html was modified to the point where it achieved a score of 90 or higher on Google's PageSpeed Insights. Some changes that had the biggest effects in optimization was reducing the amount of variables that were recalculated and only painting elements that will be seen (as opposed to also painting elements that exist but are offscreen).

Installion

Most of the files were provided Udacity. My primary contribution to this project was in views/js/main.js where changes were made to optimize the pages.
